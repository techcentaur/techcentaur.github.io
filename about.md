Hey, I'm Ankit Solanki. 24, currently living in Bangalore, India.

Currently
- Working @[Polymer](https://polymersearch.com/) as Algorithmic developer and AI engineer, building analysis engine. I joined Polymer as an early employee.
  - Using GOlang to efficiently build and scale the engine.
  - Using Python to build pipeline for LLM based systems.

(will update more here in due time).

I have not yet, and do not intend to work at any corporate job.
I have different standards for product value creation, build, shipment, and scale.
I tend to work better with self-authority or with like-minded people.

I obv have interests outside computer that I continually pursue, and that I refrain from listing here, this website is for the ease of my internet persona.

Feel free to [mail me](mailto:ankit03june@gmail.com). I reply to all emails (<7 days).
