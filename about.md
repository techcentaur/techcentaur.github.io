Hey, I'm Ankit Solanki.

Currently
- Working @[Polymer](https://polymersearch.com/) as Algorithmic (GOlang) and AI engineer (Python) as an early employee.

(More coming soon)

I have not yet, and do not intend to work at any corporate job.
I have different standards for product value creation, build, shipment, and scale.
I tend to work better with self-authority or with like-minded people.


I have ton of interest outside that I continually pursue, that I refrain from listing here. This is for ease of my internet persona.
