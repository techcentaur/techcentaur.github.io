Hey, I'm Ankit Solanki. 24, currently living in Bangalore, India.

Currently
- Working @[Polymer](https://polymersearch.com/) as Algorithmic developer and AI engineer, building analysis engine.
  - Using GOlang to efficiently build and scale the engine.
  - Using Python to build pipeline for LLM based systems.
I joined Polymer as an early employee.

(Will update more later).

I have not yet, and do not intend to work at any corporate job.
I have different standards for product value creation, build, shipment, and scale.
I tend to work better with self-authority or with like-minded people.

I have ton of interest outside that I continually pursue, that I refrain from listing here, this website is for ease of my internet persona.
