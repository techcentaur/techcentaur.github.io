<h4>things i believe in:</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
  <p>enthusiasm matters!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>it's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you</li>
    <li>energy is a necessary input for progress</li>
  </ul>

  <p>urgency is must</p>
  <ul>
    <li>slow is always fake and unclear. fast is clear and sometimes fake.</li>
    <li>a week is 2% of the year</li>
    <li>you have to put yourself on death ground, no it can not be done next week.</li>
    <li>going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit</li>
  </ul>

  <p>many people have conventional train of thought</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ask right questions, and ask well. it's better to avoid a predictable mistake than to make one.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>the cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful</p>
  <ul>
    <li>great individuals should exercise their judgment</li>
    <li>the goal is not to avoid mistakes, the goal is to achieve unparalleled levels of excellence in a given area.</li>
    <li>the downsides are worth it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>smaller teams are better</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>no room for mediocre people</li>
    <li>faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun</li>
    <li>most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed.</li>
    <li>the bottleneck in big projects is often less about resources and more about brainpower</li>
  </ul>


  <p></p>improvement is the only way to get your dopamine</p>
  <ul>
    <li>better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated</li>
    <li>don't get tied down by invisible orthodoxy, the laws of physics are the only limit</li>
    <li>the price for agency is the permanent and final realisation that the passenger seat does not exist.</li>
  </ul>
