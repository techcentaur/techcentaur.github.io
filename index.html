<h4>Things I believe in:</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
  <p>Enthusiasm matters!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you</li>
    <li>Energy is a necessary input for progress</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Urgency is MUST</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slow is always fake and unclear. Fast is clear and sometimes fake.</li>
    <li>A week is 2% of the year</li>
    <li>You have to put yourself on death ground, no it can not be done next week.</li>
    <li>Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Many people have conventioned train of thought</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask right questions, and ask well. It's better to avoid a predictable mistake than to make one.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Great individuals should exercise their judgment</li>
    <li>The goal is not to avoid mistakes, the goal is to achieve unparalleled levels of excellence in a given area.</li>
    <li>The downsides are worth it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Smaller teams are better</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>No room for mediocre people</li>
    <li>Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun</li>
    <li>Most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed.</li>
    <li>The bottleneck in big projects is often less about resources and more about brainpower</li>
  </ul>


  <p></p>Improvement is the only way to get your dopamine</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated</li>
    <li>Don't get tied down by invisible orthodoxy, the laws of physics are the only limit</li>
  </ul>
