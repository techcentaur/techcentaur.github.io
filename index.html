<h4><b>Few things I truly believe in:</b></h4>
<div class="quote-section">
  <p><b>Enthusiasm works!</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Easier to work in exciting environments (part work and part team)</li>
    <li>"The goal is not to avoid mistakes, the goal is to achieve unparalleled levels of excellence in a given area"</li>
    <li>Without energy, progress lags.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Urgency is must</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slow is fake and unclear. Fast is clear and sometimes fake.</li>
    <li>A week is 2% of the year, 5 weeks are 10%.</li>
    <li>It's essential to put yourself on death ground. It can't be done next week.</li>
    <li>Focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Many people have conventional train of thought</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask right questions, and ask well. It's better to avoid a predictable mistake than to make one.</li>
    <li>"Most people are other people", see what second-order imitation means and take your shot.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Micromanagement customs are not detrimental</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Important individuals must utilize their judgment</li>
    <li>If it feels complicated, you have not thought it through enough.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Smaller teams are better</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>No room for mediocre people</li>
    <li>Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun</li>
    <li>Most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed.</li>
    <li>Most research is extremely biased and flawed, write down actions and test.</li>
  </ul>


  <p><strong>General</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The bottleneck in big projects is often less about resources and more about brainpower</li>
    <li>Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated</li>
    <li>Don't get tied down by invisible orthodoxy, the laws of physics are the only limit</li>
    <li>The price for agency is the permanent and final realisation that the passenger seat does not exist.</li>
    <li>I believe very smart people are more practical and less idealistic, and always get what they desire. And if you don't desire anything at all, you are smart to begin with.</li>
  </ul>
