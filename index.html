<h4><b>few things i believe in:</b></h4>
<div class="quote-section">
  <p><b>enthusiasm works!</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>it's easier to work on exciting environments (part work and part team)</li>
    <li>without a degree of an outward energy, progress lags.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>urgency is must</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>slow is always fake and unclear. fast is clear and sometimes fake.</li>
    <li>a week is 2% of the year, 5 weeks are 10%.</li>
    <li>put yourself on death ground, no, it can not be done next week.</li>
    <li>focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>many people have conventional train of thought</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ask right questions, and ask well. it's better to avoid a predictable mistake than to make one.</li>
    <li>"Most people are other people", see what second-order imitation means and take your shot.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>micromanagement customs are not that detrimental</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>important individuals must utilize their judgment</li>
    <li>"the goal is not to avoid mistakes, the goal is to achieve unparalleled levels of excellence in a given area"</li>
    <li>if it feels complicated, you have not thought it through enough.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>smaller teams are better</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>no room for mediocre people</li>
    <li>faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun</li>
    <li>most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed.</li>
    <li>most research is extremely biased and flawed, write down actions and test.</li>
  </ul>


  <p><strong>general</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>the bottleneck in big projects is often less about resources and more about brainpower</li>
    <li>better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated</li>
    <li>don't get tied down by invisible orthodoxy, the laws of physics are the only limit</li>
    <li>the price for agency is the permanent and final realisation that the passenger seat does not exist.</li>
    <li>i believe very smart people are more practical and less idealistic, and always get what they desire. and if you don't desire anythig at all, you are smart to begin with.</li>
  </ul>
