I"¢<p>I think, now more than ever, I have to pick up the world on my shoulders. In all its misery, evil, suffering, 
terrible things, I have to pick it up and bear the burden. And during bearing the burden, have to realize, that I am 
the man who can do it, and therefore deserving of respect. I have never seen an idea more outright inclined to my 
human nature as of my last 24 years of experience.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s what I intend to do. And in doing that, I hope I get better, and people around me get better! A man can only 
look onto future and bear the present with all its glory and that shall be done. Either with a heavy heart or a 
light sky, that should be done.</p>
