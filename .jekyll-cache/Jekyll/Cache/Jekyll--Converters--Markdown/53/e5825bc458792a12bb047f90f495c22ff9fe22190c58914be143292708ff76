I"æ<p>Purpose of the Journal is to write whatever one want to write in an organized manner, though I wonder if I do that already â€œmore personallyâ€ among my notes then why do I write here? I canâ€™t find an answer, I am just super bored. So hereâ€™s another journal.</p>

<p>Amongst teeny-tiny sicknesses, there were a lot of ups and downs. My new Asus laptop dual boot (ubuntu 20.04) canâ€™t be connected to dual monitor due to some â€œdriverâ€ issues I guess, not sure, I tried a lot in its setup but couldnâ€™t get it done. And it seems like lot of people with Asus laptop are facing the same issues without a reliable solution. Being a cs student this sucks more than it should. Anyway Iâ€™ll keep trying and till then keep switching between laptops.</p>

<p>The weather is changing and all the natural allergies are back and thatâ€™s not the most frustrating thing, from the past two weeks Iâ€™ve been in some serious crisis or â€œangstâ€ on the comprehension of pointless of it all and this is constant. Pretty fucked up boredom. I feel like studying Particle Physics but hopefully not Abstract Algebra that btw I have to do now for passing the college-required-courses and I am NOT liking it.</p>

<p>Boredom. And a hell lot of it more. Though it might seem that Iâ€™m stuck at short term gratification and canâ€™t focus more and that might or might not be the case. But mostly itâ€™s just the casual â€œresistanceâ€ in the form of panic because of the super change in the world that took place seven months ago and which Iâ€™m noticing now. And also because my constant distractive interaction with other people have gone down significantly; oh boy! I thought I could handle it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got to take things seriously though. Now more than ever.</p>
