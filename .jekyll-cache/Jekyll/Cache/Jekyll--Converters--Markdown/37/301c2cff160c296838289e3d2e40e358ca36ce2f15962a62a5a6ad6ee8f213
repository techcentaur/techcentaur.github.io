I"Ô<p>I thinkâ€”â€”now more than everâ€”â€”that I have to pick up the world on my shoulders; in all its misery, 
evil, and suffering; Pick it up and bear the burden of the responsibility. During bearing the burden, I also 
have to realize that I am that sort of person who can do it; Therefore deserving of respect. I have never seen 
an idea more outright inclined to my basic natural instinct in all of my years. It might be something that you are 
born with, I canâ€™t explain it.</p>

<p>But, thatâ€™s what I intend to do. In the process, I hope I get better, and people around me get better. A man can 
only look onto future and bear the present with all its glory and hardwork. Either with a heavy heart or a 
light sky, it has to be done, thatâ€™s just the nature of things.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s one of the reasons why going out of India makes less to no sense to me.</p>

<p>More so than ever, Iâ€™m angry for the right reasons. Iâ€™m pissed off (at myself?â€”â€”obviously.)</p>
