I"º<p>Recently started an arguably new part-time freelancing project that involves work which can be said to lay in the range of data-engineering to deployment on AWS bucket. Meaning analysis of data and supplying it in a pipeline that would reflect the ideals in the best format onto a Vue.js based front-end framework ultimately based on AWS infrastructure. Though after a dope introduction with React and Node, I now find JS frameworks pretty aesthetic. (Am I right? From weakly-typed to aesthetic; ‚Äúthe times they‚Äôre a-changin‚Äô‚Äù.)</p>

<p>It started a couple of months ago as earlier I used to work in the post of Python Services Developer which was narrowly aimed at data-analysis and processing (the data which would get supplied somewhere.) Now I have completed most of that part, so I‚Äôve been introduced to another work as I described in first paragraph.</p>

<p>Since coming second-last semester isn‚Äôt too heavy in lieu of courses that require a lot of heavy hours (just Master‚Äôs Thesis and Computer Vision), so this would be very manageable and super interesting. Prolly going to post my experience a few weeks later.</p>

<p>This surprisingly turned out to be a very short journal. XD</p>
