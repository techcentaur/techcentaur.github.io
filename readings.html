<h2>Readings</h2>

There are lots which didn't make this list; mostly because recommendations has to be contextual by definition. Since I'm missing that, here are some unconditional recommendations from my personal library. And there is a reason this list is unorganized and incomplete.

And might as well share few quotes, which I can seem to recall more often than anything else, in the hope, that it might 
resonate with you too.

<ul>
    <li>“Don’t be overwise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid - the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.”
    </li>
    <li>“Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”
    </li>
    <li>“Life continues, and some mornings, weary of the noise, discouraged by the prospect of the interminable work to keep after, sickened also by the madness of the world that leaps at you from the newspaper, finally convinced that I will not be equal to it and that I will disappoint everyone—all I want to do is sit down and wait for evening. This is what I feel like, and sometimes I yield to it.”
    </li>
    <li>“To pretend, I actually do the thing: I have therefore only pretended to pretend.”
    </li>
    <li>“I don’t run for trains.” Snub your destiny. I have taught myself to resist running to keep on schedule. This may seem a very small piece of advice, but it registered. In refusing to run to catch trains, I have felt the true value of elegance and aesthetics in behavior, a sense of being in control of my time, my schedule, and my life. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking. You stand above the rat race and the pecking order, not outside of it, if you do so by choice.”
    </li>
    <li>“Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don’t like and are not especially good at.”
    </li>
    <li>“If I had to write a book on morality, it would have a hundred pages and ninety-nine would be blank. On the last page I should write: "I recognize only one duty, and that is to love.”
    </li>
</ul>
