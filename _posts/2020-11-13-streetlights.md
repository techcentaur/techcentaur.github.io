That night when I arrived back at my dormitory after living the inexorable set of events where my participation was—at once—an ecstasy and a confusion, it had rained. And I thought she must have written that in her poem if she cared to write as frequently as she said she does. Whether I heard the first patter on the roof of the cab or on the puddles at the roadside, I can’t particularly confirm, but the rain halted as we arrived back and winds of winter had started to blow. Back at my dorm, the first thing I turned on was the heater. Nichrome wire stirred, het up, and blazed a scorching flame with a crimson red glare that flickered throughout the room and I didn’t need to turn on the light. It was the most frigid night of the winter yet, for more than one reason with more than one intention. A paper-thin layer of ice dripped from my palms as I spread them on the front face of red Nichrome wire and it felt like a diaphanous touch of her hand, which I was holding the whole moonlit night; it dried up at once. I touched my cheeks for warmth and the frozen strip of water thawed. It smelled of her; this same fragrance, who knew, I will smell every time I will touch her in the next few months. From her hands, from her hair, from her clothes, all the same—but this smell vanished when she left on that night when she also left a void, floating in the air; which I left dawdling in the after-rain breeze of summer. Perhaps the rain washed her smell clean, but for a long time, I thought that she intentionally left her smell at her home under one of the bookmarks from the memoir she finally completed, which weren’t done the last time I saw them stacked. When I spoke my last words to her, I told her not to die, and the part of ‘her’ in my head followed this advice for a few years until one spring when I tried to imagine her face, only her voice echoed, I must have abandoned her at some dirty corner of my mind, and it didn’t come out for years until three moons ago, when another massive storm struck my town, and out of boredom I tried to find some melancholic memories of past and found it lurking behind the memory where I almost died.
