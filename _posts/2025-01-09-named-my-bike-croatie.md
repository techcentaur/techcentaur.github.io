On a recent trip to Vietnam, I met an Italian guy in Nha Trang—actually, two of them. They'd rented a few bikes, planned on traveling the whole country. We hit it off right away, spent the night drinking, laughing, the kind of easy camaraderie that comes from strangers meeting under the right stars. 

The next night, as they were getting ready to leave, I asked one of them, "You're gonna be riding this thing for months—did you name it yet?" "Of course," he said without hesitation, like it was obvious. "I named her Croatie." "Who?" "My first girlfriend," he grinned, "She taught me how to love and how to fuck. The next one? Gonna be Alyssa, Romari, Alyssa again." He said it so casually, like it was the most natural thing in the world, and it threw me off for a second. The way he looked back at his past, like it was something warm, something you hold gently in your hands. 

"Do you miss her?" I asked, not sure what kind of answer I was expecting. "Of course, I love her—that's why I'm naming my bike after her." He said it like it made perfect sense, but he couldn't understand the weight of my question, couldn't even begin to. How could he? He doesn't strangle his past like I do. He doesn't drag it behind him like some dead weight, doesn't pick at the scars. And I thought, *Could I do that?* Could I look at the past with that kind of lightness? Would it make me happy to name it after who taught me love, or how to fuck, or whatever else I've buried?

I watched him pack his bags onto Croatie. His hands were gentle, like he was touching both the bike and the memory at once. "You know what's funny?" he said, zipping up his jacket. "She hated motorcycles. Wouldn't even get on one." He laughed, and there was something beautiful about that. Later that night, I sat at the same bar we did, when the bartender asked if I was waiting for my friends to come back. "No," I said smiling, "no it's just me."

Sometimes when I'm stuck in traffic or walking past a parked motorcycle of similar kind, I think about Croatie. About how somewhere in Vietnam, she's carrying a laughing Italian through mountain passes and coastal roads. There's something to learn from he who carries his past like a song rather than a burden.

Which brings me to today (months later), I found this new chai place near home. Sat on a broken chair, second cup getting cold, couldn't stop staring at the bike showroom right across the street. Funny how memories work—I was hoping they'd hurt, make me feel something. But they're just... there. Like old songs you find yourself humming without realizing. The faces are blurry now, voices lost. Maybe that's okay. Maybe we don't need to own every story we're part of, just like I can look at the bikes, without needing to own, without needing to name.
