I think---now more than ever---that I have to pick up the world on my shoulders. In all its misery, evil, and 
suffering; I have to pick it up and bear the burden. During bearing the burden, I also have to realize that I am 
the person who can do it; And therefore deserving of respect. I have never seen an idea more outright inclined to my 
human nature as of this in all of my years.

That's what I intend to do. And in doing that I hope I get better, and people around me get better. A man can only 
look onto future and bear the present with all its glory. Either with a heavy heart or a 
light sky, that should be done.
