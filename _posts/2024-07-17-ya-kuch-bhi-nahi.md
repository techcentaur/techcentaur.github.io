There has been no verse more resonating with me over individuality than Javed B. Sheikh's this verse. While some might consider it a mixed bag of unanalysed emotions, I prefer to keep it as a perfect alignment with my natural instints; irrelevant to whether an analysis of feeling is required.

*आप कहिए तो निभाते चले जाएँगे मगर*  
*इस तअ'ल्लुक़ में अज़िय्यत के सिवा कुछ भी नहीं*

*मैं किसी तरह भी समझौता नहीं कर सकता*  
*या तो सब कुछ ही मुझे चाहिए या कुछ भी नहीं*

Never have I been more averse to the idea of conditional agreements; Be it with a friend, lover, or passion. Either I want it, in its entirety; or I would rather not pursue it at all. That's why at the slightest hint of partial commitment or adherence, I lose interest.
