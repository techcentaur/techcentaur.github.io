A good sleep is really important, but a timely sleep is a luxury. I have struggled with its timing over the years.

I justify myself by saying that I am working on something important, or that night has a bit of calmness to it; with night, there come fewer distractions. The fallen mistful and humid silence is soothing, and the flickering yellow street light right across the street from my window has never been more comforting.

But night has its own problems, not just Circadian rhythms. The city is at its most active at night, and the noise is unbearable. Yes, the street dogs are howling, but not in that way. 

Nights make it easy for memories to assault me; all pretense attitude washes away, leaving a mild sensation across my nape. My carefully crafted mindset—the philosophy of choosing pride over happiness—to forgetting the ghosts of the past across the withered wisp of clouds—dissolves with the years of held-back tears on my eyelids, and I just want to sleep. Yearnings of the past, or yearnings of sleep, I no longer know.

Over the past few months, I have tried to remember where my anger lies, and no face comes to mind; I ask what I am expecting, and no answer echoes back. Is this what absurdism feels like, Meursault? Am I your friend, Meursault? Do you know me? Perhaps I do know him, and in knowing him, perhaps I know myself.

Today, I am writing this at night, and I wonder, what part of my TODO has left? Sleep has been a distant stranger. But today, I am a bit drowsy, but I am keeping my eyes as rebelling; I'm a bit disappointed in the sleep; I'll be awake, to keep the night from winning.
