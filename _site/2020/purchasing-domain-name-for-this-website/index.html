<p>This would be the third template for my personal minimalistic blog design that I am trying.</p>

<p>I have decided to not purchase or renew my previous domain-name for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>By experience, I can say that I am not good at maintaining blog, I started first one back in 2016 during my first semester at college and then later in 2018 and 2019, but didn’t manage even one. And full year purchase of domain was more wasted than it was used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It really doesn’t matter what domain I have (given it works with HTTPS certificate) since I would be using it only for personal reasons (and maybe sharing some links of specific posts on some place else) but clearly will not be targeting any kind of audience. Purchasing domain name in this condition would only be for personal satisfaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If I got habitual into writing some journal entries or blog posts, I will purchase one. Either <code class="highlighter-rouge">techcentaur</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ankit</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">solanki</code> phrase would be included in it.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be too much deviation to say that this was one of the reasons why I didn’t choose Netlify as a platform (since it supports Ruby gems providing me more flexibility by adding word-tag clouds). I will change platform eventually just not till I get habitual.</p>
